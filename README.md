Attempts to open sample.txt for reading.

If the file is found, displays each line prefixed by its line number.

If the file is not found, prints a descriptive error message indicating the absence of the file.

This ensures both smooth reading of file contents and clear feedback on errors, improving user experience and reliability.

Takes user input and writes it to a file called output.txt.

Takes more input and appends it to the same file.

Reads and displays the final content of the file after write and append operations.

It ensures that both writing and appending to a file are demonstrated, with all user-entered data shown at the end.This program writes user input to output.txt, appends more input to the same file, and finally displays the complete content of the file.
